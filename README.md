# LagGuard

## A World of Warcraft Classic Hardcore Addon

LagGuard is a specialized addon designed to protect hardcore players from deaths due to unexpected lag spikes. By continuously monitoring your connection to the game servers, LagGuard provides timely warnings when your latency reaches dangerous levels, giving you a chance to react before it's too late.

## Features

- **Real-time Latency Monitoring**: Constantly tracks both home and world server latency
- **Smart Baseline Detection**: Establishes your normal baseline connection quality and detects deviations
- **Multi-level Warning System**: Provides escalating alerts based on severity
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Set your own latency thresholds for warnings
- **Visual Status Indicator**: Shows your current connection status at a glance
- **Multiple Alert Types**: Configurable text, sound, and screen flash warnings
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Designed to be lightweight and efficient

## Usage

After installation, LagGuard will automatically begin monitoring your connection. You'll see a small indicator in the top-right corner of your screen showing your current connection status:

- **Green**: Connection is good
- **Orange**: Caution - Minor latency issues detected
- **Yellow**: Warning - Significant latency detected
- **Red**: Danger - Severe latency issues detected

When latency spikes occur, you'll receive alerts based on your settings, which may include:
- On-screen text warnings
- Sound alerts
- Screen flashes (for severe warnings)
- Chat messages

- **/lg toggle** - Toggles the addon on/off
- **/lg config** - Opens the configuration panel

## Configuration

LagGuard offers extensive customization through its configuration panel:

1. Alert Types: Choose which alert methods to enable (sound, text, screen flash)
2. Thresholds: Set the latency levels that trigger different warning levels
3. Monitoring Options: Configure which latency types to monitor (home/world)
4. Baseline Settings: Adjust how your normal latency baseline is calculated

## For Hardcore Players

In the unforgiving world of hardcore mode, a single death means the end of your character. Network lag is one of the few factors outside of your control that can lead to an unfair death. LagGuard helps mitigate this risk by:

1. Warning you to stop engaging in combat when lag is detected
2. Giving you time to find a safe location
3. Alerting you when it's safe to continue playing
4. Providing visual feedback about your connection health at all times

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lagguard) or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info-LagGuard.html)
2. Extract the folder into your World of Warcraft\_classic_\\Interface\\AddOns directory
3. Restart World of Warcraft if it's currently running
4. Ensure the addon is enabled in your addon list
